                            We understand that even the best-laid plans of
                            interstellar adventurers can go awry. If you need to

                            any cancellations made on the day of arrival cannot
                            be refunded.

                            However, in the rare event of a severe galactic
                            storm or other adverse cosmic events, the park may
                            close for the safety of our visitors and crew. In
                            such cases, visitors will be offered a full refund

                            travel documents are in order as we cannot permit

                            Anti-gravity antics, while fun, should be kept
                            within the safe zones marked around the park.
