                        <p>
                            We understand that even the best-laid plans of
                            interstellar adventurers can go awry. If you need to
                            cancel your expedition, full refunds are available
                            for tickets canceled at least 72 hours before the
                            designated entry time. Cancellations made less than

                            any cancellations made on the day of arrival cannot
                            be refunded.

                            Our park is open come rain or meteor showers!
                            However, in the rare event of a severe galactic
                            storm or other adverse cosmic events, the park may
                            close for the safety of our visitors and crew. In
                            such cases, visitors will be offered a full refund
                            or the option to reschedule their visit to a clearer
                            day.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Entry Requirements:</h3>

                            pass and their ticket at the entry gate. Digital and
                            printed tickets are accepted. Ensure that your
                            travel documents are in order as we cannot permit
                            entry to those without proper identification.

                            guidelines and instructions from park operatives.
                            Anti-gravity antics, while fun, should be kept
                            within the safe zones marked around the park.
